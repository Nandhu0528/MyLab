My Own Basic commands to start with github

1. git clone "https://github.com/Nandhu0528/MyLab.git"  ##(Clone the master repo to your local branch. )
2. git checkout -b local ##(git checkout to new branch, here "local" is new branch name)
3. git branch -a ##(list all branches)
4. git add filename ##(add the changes to the file and commit with message )
5 git commit -m filename
6. git merge local ##( switch to local main branch and do git merge with branch name, it will merge to your main branch)
7. git push -u origin main ##(Changes will get pushed remote main branch directly)

##### Instead of performing cloning each and every time, Start with upstream in git

git branch --set-upstream-to origin/master master ##(the follwing command will help to setup a your master repo as a referecen point)

git pull --rebase ##(Here the latest changes will be automatically pulled from your master branch to your local branch)
